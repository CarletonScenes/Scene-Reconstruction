Take pictures of buildings

SOBEL - edge detection algorithm

Algorithms built into OpenCV
- SIFT (recommended by Jadrian too)
- SURF (tested today)
- FAST
- ORB (nonpatented)

RANSAC finds matching key features between images (correspondence)

Camera position / correspondence (registration?) -> 3dify (modeling, rendering)

need to find algorithms to translate correspondence to 3d model

- finding intrinsic camera info
- rigid transformation of camera pose
- find 3d location of matched keypoint features (using epipolar lines)
